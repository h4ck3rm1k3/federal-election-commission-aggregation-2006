    lists. The price paid for thses mail lists was set by the vendor. The beginning
    COH reflects accurate numbers from the Committee's internal audit.  With regard
    to Schedule A supporting Line 15 of the Committee's report, the Committee made
    a number of payments for payroll taxes for the 2004 election cycle.  However,
    some of these taxes were incurred for employees who were dedicated wholly to nonfederal
    election activity in a particular state.  To comply with state law, the Committee's
    state PAC was required to reimburse the Committee for the portion of payroll taxes
    that was attributable to those employees.  The $22,406.19 that was disclosed as
    an offset on the February Monthly Report corresponded to the portion of payroll
    taxes attributable to those employees, and for which reimbursement had not yet
    been made. The $10,000.50 from Stone's Phones disclosed on Schedule A supporting
    Line 15 was a refund of an original disbursement to Field Works reported as an
    allocable expense. The Committee will transfer $9,000.45, the Non-Federal portion
    of the refund, to the Committee's Non-Federal account and in this report will
    be shown as a debt on Schedule D. The disbursements to Integral Resources for
    'Telemarketing Expense' and the disbursements to OMP for 'Direct Mail Postage'
    were both for ongoing Federal fundraising efforts of the Committee and no portion
    of those expenses involved public communications, voter drive activity, or express
    advocacy of a Federal Candidate.'The Disbursements for 'Direct Mail Consulting'
    and 'Direct Mail Processing' are for ongoing Federal fundraising efforts of the
    Committee. No portion of these expenditures involved public communication, voter
    drive activity, or express advocacy of a Federal Candidate. The expenditures for
    'Communications Consulting' were for general consulting to the Committee and did
    not involve any public communication or voter drive activity. The Committee has
    provided information to disclose the original vendors for the credit card activity,
    and the travel reimbursements. However, the Committee was unable to locate information
    for one reimbursement for travel disclosed on Schedule H4. We will make every
    attempt to identify the original vendor for the disbursement to Toni Kendall.
    We will then file amendments to this report to disclose the vendor(s)."
