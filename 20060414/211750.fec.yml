    were incorrectly reported for 2004 Primary Debt Retirement which should have been
    reported for the 2006 Primary because they were not specifically designated for
    debt retirement.  Conversely, there were also some contributions reported for
    the 2006 Primary and/or 2006 General, which should have been reported for 2004
    Primary Debt Retirement because they were specifically designated for debt retirement.  There
    were some PAC contributions reported under an incorrect FEC id number; for example,
    a contribution from the NAPUS PAC for Postmasters was reported from the National
    Association of Postal Supervisors PAC.  Other examples include contributions from
    the national offices of PACs being reported from the PACs of local offices instead.  Some
    contributions were reported as having been received on the deposit date rather
    than the actual date of receipt.  In reviewing the check copies and attached envelopes,
    the correct receipt date was ascertained and changed.  In the instances where
    there was no such proof, the period and cycle was changed.  For example, there
    were a number of contributions reported as having been received on 11/19/04 and
    designated for the 2004 General election.  For those contributions that could
    be shown to have been received on or before 11/2/04, the dates were changed.  For
    those contributions where the received date could not be ascertained, the period
    and cycle was changed to 2006 Primary.  There were some contributions, both individual
    and PAC, which were not originally reported.  ",""'
