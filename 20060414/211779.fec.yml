    the correct receipt date was ascertained and changed.  In the instances where
    there was no such proof, the period and cycle was changed.  For example, there
    were a number of contributions reported as having been received on 11/19/04 and
    designated for the 2004 General election.  For those contributions that could
    be shown to have been received on or before 11/2/04, the dates were changed.  For
    those contributions where the received date could not be ascertained, the period
    and cycle was changed to 2006 Primary.  There were some contributions, both individual
    and PAC, which were not originally reported.  ",""'
