  input: 'TEXT,F3XA,,"This amendment is in response to your letter of July 12, 2006
    regarding our June Monthly report.  Commission regulations in effect for salaries
    paid after January 19, 2006, require parties to allocate as administrative expenses
    any payments for salaries, payroll taxes and benefits for employees who spend
    more than 0% but less than 25% of compensated time in a month on FEA or activity
    in connection with a Federal election. The payments on Schedule H4 are for employees
    in this class.  House Democratic Campaign Committee is not a political party committee,
    nor is it established, financed, maintained or controlled, by any National, State
    or Local political party committee. Its contribution is permissible as Levin funds.  We
    have corrected the committee ID numbers on Schedule 11c.  This amendment also
    reflicets the following changes from the original report: a contribution previously
    disclosed on line 11aii is now itemized on Schedule A for line 11c; and the Summary
    and Detailed Summary pages reflect that change as well as the changes to our February
    Monthly report.",'
