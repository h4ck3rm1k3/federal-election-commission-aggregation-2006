    value: There were no cash contributions from any one individual or other entity
      equal to or in excess of $100.00.  All salary or wage payment were to people
      who spent less than 25% of their time in connection with Federal Election Activity.      Schedule
      D shows no debt in this amended report because we are not on the accrual method
      of accounting and the liability for payroll taxes should not have been shown
      in the first place since it is reported as an expenditure as paid.  Also the
      liability was not for services or because of any borrowing from a financial
      institution or anybody else.
